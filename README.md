Bugs: Noticed Adblock can block certain aspects of the icons and animations. As well as the footer button.
Seems to need to change fa to something else https://help.getadblock.com/support/solutions/articles/6000148708-adblock-blocks-font-awesome-social-media-icons.

Improvements: Change all images to a smaller size to fit the container. As well as changing the type of image to a new type. 

Updates: Febuary 20, 2019. Added webp using Node.js with fallback images. Need to figure how to do background images in webp.
